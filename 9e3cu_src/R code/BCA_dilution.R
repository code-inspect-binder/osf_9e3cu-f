# Correct the BCA assay data for dilution
# It is helpful (but not necessary) to pair this activity with the BCA activity as the numbers carry over
# One possible set of answers to this activity are provided on OSF in the answers folder in a file called BCA_dilution_answers

# Students will learn:
# How to use the mutate function to create new columns using data from existing column (mutate in tidyverse)
# How to make a table of data (maybe knitr, data.table)
# How to fit data (if not done in the BCA Assay activity) (nlstools)
# How to rename columns (colnames)
# How to filter and select data (filter and select in tidyverse)

#######
# import BCAdata.csv

# If not done already, calculate the equation of the standards line

# Use the equation of the line to calculate the concentration of the samples in the data

# Correct samples for dilution

# Rename the columns and display the data as a table
