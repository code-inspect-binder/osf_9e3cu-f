# BCA curve and calculation activity
# students should follow the comments shown to carry out each of the tasks
# Students will likely need to search Stack Overflow or the tidyverse sites for
# how to complete tasks
# the data are found in the BCA data folder in xlsx and .csv format. 

### Things students will do:
# comment their code appropriately
# import data (readxl package)
# make a plot (typically using ggplot2) and add a trendline (ggplot2)
# calculate the equation of the line (nlstools or lm)
# calculate the R^2 of the trendline (nlstools)

# an answer key is find in the answers folder a BCA_activity_answer.R


#######
# import BCAdata.csv

# plot the calibration curve (Abs vs. [BSA]) with an appropriate trendline 

# calculate the equation of the standards line, show the general equation below

# calculate the R^2 value
